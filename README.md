# assignBot
Proof of concept. Role assignment concept bot made for Invictus Intergalactic Federation.

Step-by-Step:
1. verify .env contains the correct keys
2. verify that role names are correct for the server that you are now in
3. create the embed message with !embed in the text channel of your choice
4. get the message id of that new embed and copy/paste it into the code on line 77 (if message_id == <your message id>)
5. restart the bot to save the changes made
6. test bot by selecting the reactions and seeing if role is assigned
